However, it's difficult to determine the exact location and extent due to the poor image quality.\n*   **Heart Size:** The heart size is difficult to assess accurately due to the image quality.\n*   **Mediastinum:** The mediastinum (the central area of the chest containing the heart, great vessels, and trachea) appears relatively normal, but again, it's hard to be certain.\n*   **Bones:** The ribs and other bony structures are visible, but they are not well-defined.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   **Low Resolution:** The image is very low resolution, making it difficult to see fine details.\n*   **Lack of Contrast:** The contrast is poor, making it hard to differentiate between different densities.\n*   **Image Quality:** The image is not clear, and it is difficult to make any definitive conclusions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDue to the poor image quality, it is not possible to provide a definitive diagnosis.
