Prompt: Baseline (Open-ended)

Based on the provided image, here's a description of the chest X-ray:

**Overall Impression:** The image appears to be a chest X-ray, but it is heavily degraded and difficult to interpret due to the low resolution and lack of contrast.

**Observations:**

*   **Opacity:** There is some degree of opacity (whiteness) in the lower lung fields, potentially indicating fluid or consolidation. However, it's difficult to determine the exact location and extent due to the poor image quality.
*   **Heart Size:** The heart size is difficult to assess accurately due to the image quality.
*   **Mediastinum:** The mediastinum (the central area of the chest containing the heart, great vessels, and trachea) appears relatively normal, but again, it's hard to be certain.
*   **Bones:** The ribs and other bony structures are visible, but they are not well-defined.

**Limitations:**

*   **Low Resolution:** The image is very low resolution, making it difficult to see fine details.
*   **Lack of Contrast:** The contrast is poor, making it hard to differentiate between different densities.
*   **Image Quality:** The image is not clear, and it is difficult to make any definitive conclusions.

**Conclusion:**

Due to the poor image quality, it is not possible to provide a definitive diagnosis. The opacity in the lower lung fields could be due to various causes, such as fluid, consolidation, or atelectasis. Further evaluation with a higher-quality image is needed for a more accurate interpretation.

**Disclaimer:** This is a preliminary interpretation based on a low-quality image. A qualified radiologist should be consulted for a definitive diagnosis.

Prompt: Structured Clinical Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FINDINGS:
The chest X-ray shows a clear lung field with no obvious consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The heart size appears normal. The mediastinum is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.

CLASSIFICATION:
Normal.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prompt: Constrained Binary Assessment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  **No**
2.  **There is no clear evidence of pneumonia in this image.** The image is too blurry to see any consolidation, infiltrates, or other typical signs of pneumonia.
3.  **Low**
