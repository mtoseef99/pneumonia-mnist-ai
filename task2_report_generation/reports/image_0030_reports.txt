Prompt: Baseline (Open-ended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Based on the provided image, here's a description of the chest X-ray:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a frontal view of the chest. The lungs appear relatively clear, but there are some subtle findings that warrant further investigation.

**Specific Findings:**

*   **Lung Fields:** The lung fields are generally clear, with no obvious large consolidations or effusions.
*   **Heart Size:** The heart size appears within normal limits.
*   **Mediastinum:** The mediastinum (the space between the lungs containing the heart, great vessels, trachea, etc.) appears unremarkable.
*   **Bones:** The ribs and clavicles are visible.
*   **Possible Subtle Findings:** There are some subtle opacities or densities in the lung fields, particularly in the lower lung regions. These could represent various conditions, such as atelectasis (collapsed lung tissue), small nodules, or early signs of infection.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Image Quality:** The image quality is somewhat limited due to the low resolution and potential artifacts. This makes it difficult to assess subtle details.
*   **Clinical Context:** A definitive diagnosis cannot be made based on this image alone. The clinical history, symptoms, and other relevant information are crucial for interpretation.

**Disclaimer:**

I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses. A qualified radiologist or physician should interpret the X-ray image in the context of the patient's clinical presentation.

Prompt: Structured Clinical Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FINDINGS:
The image shows a chest X-ray. The lungs appear clear bilaterally. The heart size is normal. The mediastinum is unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CLASSIFICATION:
Normal

Prompt: Constrained Binary Assessment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  **No**
2.  **There is no clear evidence of pneumonia in this image.** The lung fields appear relatively clear, without consolidation, infiltrates, or other typical signs of pneumonia.
3.  **Low**
    *   The image quality is poor, making it difficult to assess for subtle findings.
    *   Without a comparison to a previous image or a clear clinical context, it's hard to be certain.
    *   The lack of specific findings makes it difficult to confidently rule out pneumonia.
